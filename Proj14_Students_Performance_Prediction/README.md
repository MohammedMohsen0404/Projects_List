## Summary
This project aims to develop predictive models to forecast high school students' academic performance based on their demographics, study habits, parental involvement, and extracurricular activities. The dataset consists of comprehensive information on 2,392 students, with the goal of predicting their grades and understanding factors influencing academic success.

## Objective
- Build models to predict students' academic performance.
- Utilize a dataset with various features related to student demographics and activities.
- Enhance educational research and support interventions to improve student outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **StudentID:** Unique identifier for each student.
- **Age:** Age of the student.
- **Gender:** Gender of the student (0 for female, 1 for male).
- **Ethnicity:** Ethnicity of the student.
- **ParentalEducation:** Highest level of education attained by the student's parents.
- **StudyTimeWeekly:** Weekly study time in hours.
- **Absences:** Number of absences.
- **Tutoring:** Whether the student receives tutoring (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **ParentalSupport:** Level of parental support.
- **Extracurricular:** Participation in extracurricular activities.
- **Sports:** Participation in sports.
- **Music:** Participation in music activities.
- **Volunteering:** Participation in volunteering activities.
- **GPA:** Grade Point Average of the student.
- **GradeClass:** Target variable categorizing students' grades.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Data:** Student performance dataset
